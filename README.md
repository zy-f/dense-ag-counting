# Dense Agricultural Counting
Final project for EE292D/CS329E: Machine Learning on Embedded Systems.

## Setup
For consistent environment, please use the provided conda environment yml file. To use (assuming you have conda), run `conda env create -f ag_env.yml`  from your local clone of the project repository.

Please note that `quantization.py` is a standalone scrap file and currently does not match the environment (we ended up working in different codespaces); it's included mainly for reference/perusal.
